### Hi, I'm Brian 👋

## About Me 📖
Welcome to my GitHub! I am **Brian**, a bald, bearded South African postgraduate scholar with a _deep_ fascination for high-level machine learning, i.e. AI systems development. I am passionate about solving the scientific world's most challenging problems while absorbing any and all knowledge along the way. My academic journey is a tapestry of mathematics, radio astronomy, statistics, computer science and AI.
